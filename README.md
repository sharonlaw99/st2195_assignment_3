# Construct an SQLite Database
In this assignment, we will be constructing an SQLite database called **airline2.db** using both R and Python programming language.

We will be using tables which contains data that were obtained from the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7) known as *Data Expo 2009: Airline on time data*.

# Solve a query
Which airplane has the lowest associated average departure delay (excluding cancelled and diverted flights)?

### References
The tables used with their respective data from the Harvard Dataverse is listed below:

1. ontime (data from 2000 - 2005, including 2000 and 2005)

2. airports (data in airports.csv)

3. carriers (data in carriers.csv)

4. planes (data in plane-data.csv)
